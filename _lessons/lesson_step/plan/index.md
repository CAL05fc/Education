### What is a Lesson?

Lessons are education materials publically available to support skillbuiliding of best data management practices. Lessons can include pdf and powerpoint slide decks, handouts, and supporting exercises and data that you can download and incorporate into your teaching materials. Materials are licensed as CC0 and you may enhance and reuse for your own purposes. In many cases slides can be previewed in the embedded slideshare viewer. We also provide one-page synopses (with space for contact information) that can be used to promote Data Management training events at your institution.

Please consider sharing your own data management teaching materials. For more information see our Frequently Asked Questions and Contributor Guidelines.

### What is the "Plan" stage?

Map out the processes and resources for the entire data life cycle. Start with the project goals (desired outputs, outcomes, and impacts) and work backwards to build a data management plan, supporting data policies, and sustainability plans.
